# Visualizations-Using-R
This repository contains advanced visualizations created using the `ggplot2` and `plotly` libraries in R.

## About

In this project, I explored various advanced visualization techniques using R, focusing on creating visually appealing and informative plots. The visualizations are divided into two main categories: `ggplot2` and `plotly`.

### ggplot2 Visualizations

In the `visualization/ggplot2` folder, you'll find advanced visualizations created using the `ggplot2` library. These visualizations include:

- Scatterplots
- Boxplots
- Violin Plots
- Ridgeline Plots
- Stacked Density Plots
- Heatmaps

Each visualization is accompanied by a brief description and a screenshot.
